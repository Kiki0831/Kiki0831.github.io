<h3>Extended example: Historical baby names</h3>
<p>I know you might think these plots are too simple and now let’s create a more complicated plot with ggplot and ggplotly.We will use the make_babynames_dist() function in the mdsr package to add some more convenient variables to our dataset and to filter for only the data that is relevant to people alive in 2014. <br /></p>

<p><br /> First we need to filter the data so that we only have babies with the name David who are male. <br /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>david &lt;- BabynamesDist %&gt;%
  filter(name ==&quot;David&quot; &amp; sex == &quot;M&quot;)
name_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = david)</code></pre>
<p><br /> Now we will plot the number of David’s born each year who are estimated to be alive on January 1,2014.We will get that estimate by multipling the number of Davids born in a year by the probability that a person from that year will be alive on January 1,2014. <br /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>name_plot &lt;- name_plot +
  geom_bar(stat = &#39;identity&#39;, aes(x=year,y=count_thousands * alive_prob),

name_plot</code></pre>
<p><img src="blog_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><br /> Now we will add the line for the number of Davids born each year to our plot. <br /n></p>
<pre class="r"><code>name_plot &lt;- name_plot + geom_line(aes(x = year, y=count_thousands),
